Inspired by the image generation by @DanielWalm60394, @IroncladDev generated and modified an AI image with DALLE-3 of a horse, ThePrimeagen, a Bison, and a Camel (all of which had laser eyes) trading money on a table. This meme was retweeted by @htmx_org and titled "Shill of the month"

The meme was later added to the HTMX merch store as a cup captioned with "htmx influencer program SHILL OF THE MONTH".

This trend has slowly died out over time and has been discontinued as of late October 2023.
