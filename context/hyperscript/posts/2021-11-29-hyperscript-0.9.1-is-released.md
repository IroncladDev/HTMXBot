## hyperscript 0.9.1 Release

We are pleased to present the
[0.9.1 release](https://unpkg.com/browse/hyperscript.org@0.9.1/)
of hyperscript.

### Changes

* The [`if`](/commands/if/) command now supports the alternative `otherwise` syntax as an alternative to the normal `else`

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug when using [`show`](/commands/show) with elements that have explicit `display:none` styles
* A better error message when a `return` statement is used when an `exit` command is called for

Enjoy!
