## hyperscript 0.9.8 Release

We are pleased to present the [0.9.8 release](https://unpkg.com/browse/hyperscript.org@0.9.8/) of hyperscript.

### Changes

* Scientific-notation style numbers are now supported (e.g. `1e6`)
* Event-filters can refer to properties directly in the `details` object of events
* The new `mod` operator can be used for modulo
* An embarrassing bug in the `exists` operator was fixed
* Many other smaller bug fixes

Enjoy!
