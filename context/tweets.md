but (&amp; this is s big but) you also need to either provide a hypermedia client for your API or ask your API consumers to write hypermedia clients:

- Tweet: yeah, i don't think "HTML is heavier than JSON" holds up if you make lean HTML a focus:
the CPU/memory burn of producing a JSON rep &amp; a partial HTML rep of a resource is going to be almost identical
especially after zipping the payloads will be nearly identical
  > **@lorenzoglorenzo:**
  > What I don't understand is why rendering HTML strings should be heavier than rendering JSON strings.

should htmx 2.0 include a morph-style swap based on idiomorph (https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph/…)
cost = ~2kb

- Tweet: at some level this is true: htmx breaks the core mechanics of hypermedia controls down to their component parts:
- an event
- triggers an HTTP request
- receives a hypermedia response
- updates the state of the client based on that response somehow
htmx is hypermedia assembly

what scales?
- independence
- flexibility

- caching
hypermedia gives you all these in spades!
it's silly to say it won't scale
now it might not be able to pull off the UX you need (do you _really_ need it?  really?) sure, but scaling isn't the issue
  > **@heyotetsuo:**
  > I think ppl make big systems for scaling and forget that scaling is about performance and that small, simple systems perform very well. Big systems cost way more, take way longer to build/fix/deploy, and are way harder to rework. I dunno, big systems are a big risk to me.

- Tweet: beware bifurcating mythologizers!
  > **@goodtweetsalex:**
  > i made another meme about HTML
- Images: The idea of fullstack development is based on the flawed premise that the hypermedia representation of the service has independent concerns from the service itself. The introduction of a separate, stateful entity on the client introduces an entire class of errors that are impossible if the service simply returns HTML text that represents the current state at the time of the request. Bifurcating web development into two classes of developers only serves to mythologize the capabilities of each in a way that makes their individual skills seem paradoxically both more unattainable and less valuable.

- Tweet: an important point!
htmx &amp; the hypermedia approach does away w/the front-end/back-end split :
no need to coordinate between people
allows optimization across the whole stack
no need to version your API
resilient to API changes via HATEOAS
a very powerful feature!
  > **@atmorojo:**
  > I'm new to htmx. And working with htmx is very different compared to working with JS UI frameworks. Htmx tied FE and BE very tightly that if there's a case where I have to hx-get="/foobar?page=5&amp;filterblahblah" I'll come to the BE guy (me) and smack his face.

htmx scopes down your client side scripting to the point that the older ad hoc, frameworkless approach to scripting works well in many cases
http://hyperscript.org is for just such sorts of scripting 
basically next-gen jQuery
or maybe prev-gen jQuery...

however, a hypermedia system decouples your network client (the browser) from your hypermedia API _at the system level_
  > **@kdhrubo:**
  > Wondering what does this decoupling mean for so called full stack engineer 😁😁

- Tweet: this is loose coupling only in theory
in practice, you end up creating end-points that are specific to your front end needs OR adopting a general solution like GraphQL, with its attendant security issues (see Facebooks GraphQL whitelists, most people don't do this correctly)
  > **@PAStheLoD:**
  > to achieve loose coupling. backend team API/JSON only, frontend team does presentation layer stuff. not every project needs this, obviously (?)
  > it makes sense to do UI first, prototype, then add a server. but the frontend ecosys still sucks :/ hence inverse solutions like HTMX

- Tweet: client side rendering is only simpler than server side rendering w/a JavaScript-first mindset
as soon as you let go of that &amp; re-embrace hypermedia, SSR is *dramatically* simpler
i still have no idea what hydration means &amp; absolutely refuse to learn on general principle
  > **@devongovett:**
  > The reason client rendering is still popular is that it is so much simpler than SSR. SSR can be a huge pain — dealing with hydration, environment differences, effects not running on the server, etc. For some apps, the DX of CSR outweighs the marginal UX benefits of SSR. twitter.com/dan_abramov/st…

I now realize that the decoupling has to be on *both* sides of the wire
producing a hypermedia API isn't enough
you also have to have a hypermedia *client* that can effectively work w/your API
  > **@ArghRich:**
  > Great answer. 
  > As usual, decoupling is hard, and SPAs really show that no one wants to put in the hard work but instead join everything in the client.

- Tweet: this is a fair &amp; common take on returning to hypermedia
but it's important to recognize that today's SPAs are really the 2nd (?) coming of 1980s thick clients, using fixed format data protocols
*hypermedia* is the newer technology
so we are going back:
back to the future!

- Tweet: a controversial take, but we are very bullish on hypermedia!
  > **@JustinMitchel:**
  > HTML over the wire as a cocept and practice (@htmx_org, hotwire, etc) will outlast modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Vue, Angular, etc).

- Tweet: &gt; a web server...
&gt; responding to HTTP requests...
&gt; with... HTML?
an idea so crazy, it just might work!
  > **@quii:**
  > Yes it's a simple TODO app, but you'll notice it _feels_ like an SPA, no full page reloads, but none of the hell of making an SPA, thanks to @htmx_org  
  > I made a go web server, that responds to HTTP requests with HTML. Just like the good old days.

- Tweet: &gt; playing with puzzles
this is something that I have noticed too
when you are flowing with hypermedia, solutions to UI problems are different than in straight-ahead RPC-style appls
feels more like fitting puzzle pieces together, or maybe legoing?
hard to explain!
  > **@Worl72298158Sam:**
  > A great morning to be sitting here coding in Clojure and using the AMAZING @htmx library - and no wasteful meeting interruptions to boot!  @htmx results in the removal of SO much complexity when building dynamic web apps. Feels like playing with fun puzzles, actually.

- Tweet: &gt; a clear mental model
at times htmx is more work than other hypermedia-oriented options (e.g. hotwire)
this is an intentional tradeoff: by building incrementally on top of HTML we keep a solid &amp; well established mental model for the library
tradeoffs! https://t.co/ADVx4DTPHk

- Tweet: a prescient warning!
but a far greater danger is that you'll spend a few hours learning htmx &amp; the underlying REST-ful architecture of the web &amp; become incensed that we spent so much time and effort replicating 1980's thick clients in the browser!
forewarned is forearmed!
  > **@inouire:**
  > Be very careful, if it doesn't suit you, you will never get back the 15 minutes you spent to make it work with your app.

  > **@Worl72298158Sam:**
  > Yes, agreed.  After spending time with @htmx_org, it became fairly obvious to me that we took a wrong turn. We should have enhanced HTML instead of charging into a 15-year odyssey trying to re-create rich client-server apps over HTTP, mimicking some terrible RPC/JSON architecture

https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/dev/src/ext/head-merge.js…
gives you a few options for preserving head elements, otherwise does a diff/sync, w/ proper CSS, js execution, etc + a nice event system

- Tweet: Occasionally I hear that w/htmx "my code will be spaghetti"
htmx pushes the factoring problem to the server side
a properly factored htmx application should be *easier* to understand than an equivalent SPA due to locality of behavior &amp; reduced abstractions
it's just HTML!

- Tweet: the 1.8.1 release should bring morph-swapping up to par with normal innerHTML swapping as far as seamless behavior in htmx
i've created a section on the topic, including a link to idiomorph, my take on the concept:

- Tweet: happy to announce htmx v1.8.1 has been released: 
https://htmx.org/posts/2022-10-11-htmx-1.8.1-is-released/…
some highlights:
* we properly track requests so multiple elements can share a request indicator
* we will re-initialize an element that has been mutated when calling htmx.process()
* idiomorph (!!!)

in many circles, returning HTML to an HTTP request isn’t just considered idiosyncratic, it’s a show stopper

the target of the htmx request is the entire page, but the video has an id on it

- htmx pushes most factoring to the back-end, so take advantage of the tools your language/framework provide there
- don't get too cutesy, simple &amp; sufficient &gt; complext &amp; perfect
  > **@ZachKazanski:**

- Tweet: ok, a super pre-alpha version of idiomorph is ready for anyone insane who wants to try it:
https://github.com/bigskysoftware/idiomorph/blob/main/dist/idiomorph.js…
it offers two types of morphing: outerHTML and innerHTML (matching htmx swap styles) 
it's a little bigger than I'd like at 1.4k min/gz'd, but it is what it is

- Tweet: reworked idiomoroph to be a bit cleaner and faster (about as fast as morphdom)
code is here:

still needs a lot of testing...
😑

- Tweet: ok, so the next question was perf: would idiomorph perform well enough
it isn't going to be as fast as morphdom because it is doing more to merge more stabily
restults w/ an HTML5 demo page &amp; a 500-row 5-col table
so, within reason

tell five developers you know about hypermedia driven libs like http://unpoly.com, http://hotwire.dev, http://htmx.org and http://hyperview.org

Got into @htmx_org last week and thanks to the django-htmx package by @AdamChainz, this page has been reworked completely.

- Tweet: an important thing to know for htmx devs!
since you now have access to PUT/PATCH/DELETE, if you are implementing the Post/Redirect/Get (PRG) pattern w/them, you'll want to use a 303 redirect rather than a 302
this has tripped me up as many web frameworks default to a 302!

- Tweet: do you want to know how I got these scars?
my employer was an enterprise shop &amp; a fad chaser
one day they went off crazier than usual &amp; decided to adopt extjs wholesale for the entire app
i told them about  HATEOAS &amp; hypermedia
they didn't like that
not. one. bit.

"The new wave of React state mgmt:
Understand the core problems state management libraries need to solve &amp; how the proliferation of modern libraries address them in new ways"
dunno guys, maybe we should use hypermedia as the engine of application state..

also, love the hyperscript flex to highlight the selected tab!
on htmx:afterOnLoad 
    take .text-indigo-600 for http://event.target
could be written as:

    take .text-indigo-600 for the event's target

release notes:
https://github.com/bigskysoftware/htmx/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md#180---2022-02-2…
targeting July 4th for release

- Tweet: fresh is a full stack JS/TS library, so it's a total web app solution: you use it for front end &amp; back end work
htmx focuses tightly on making the hypermedia we have, HTML, more powerful, and thus is back end agnostic: use whatever you want to produce HTML
  > **@bbarski:**
  > Can see many more js frameworks getting out of "SPA for everything" and getting back to SSR with "islands pattern". Recently Deno with "Fresh" framework. How does this compare to htmx/hotwire? Not sure about url push functionality there.

why take the hardest aspect of software development, decomposing your system properly &amp; introduce a network dependency there?
*macroservices* I get, but i'm just not smart enough to grok microservices
  > **@kdhrubo:**
  > SPA + Microservices = Killer combo. Projects that would normally take 4-5 months now takes 12 months. Technical requirements &gt;&gt; than actual business requirements. everyone is overwhelmed chasing the fancy star. But not many realize or calculates the damage.

- Tweet: daily reminder that htmx officially supports IE11 and htmx 1.0 will support IE in perpetuity
mainly because its hilarious
hyperscript cannot and will not ever support IE

- Tweet: hypermedia thinking is a different approach to building distributed systems, but quite powerful!
  > **@bennettscience:**
  > I feel like @htmx_org has helped me develop better design patterns, thinking through how to make server responses more flexible and wrapping responses in more reusable HTML snippets.

- Tweet: maybe we should be checking dependencies into source control

- Tweet: daily reminder
  > **@cemerick:**
  > e.g. angular or react simply could not exist without google or facebook and their extended ecosystem of institutional patrons; meanwhile, e.g. htmx is absurdly small (like 2kloc of straightforward JS source IIRC), so any competent JS dev can maintain and contribute to it.

- Tweet: an annoyance that occasionally comes up on the htmx discord is that option elements don't fire an event on selection
hyperscript to the rescue!
we can catch a change event and fire a 'click' on the selected option element to simulate the right thing!

check in on the discord if you have specific issues you want me to look at:

thank you again to all the sponsors of htmx and hyperscript, especially @intellijidea

- Tweet: not going to confirm that lighting bolts may come out of your fingers and that u may experience some small dermatological side effects when using htmx + hyperscript
not going to deny it
but not going to confirm it
  > **@IamFridayLove:**
  > I’ve been using django/htmx/hyperscript for 6 months in production now and I feel like I’ve barely scratched the surface.

- Tweet: daily reminder: if nothing magically works, nothing magically breaks
  > **@htmx_org:**
  > yes, htmx is an extension of HTML as a hypermedia &amp;, like HTML, is back end agnostic
  > good: works w/ anything, conceptually coherent w/ HTML, no magic
  > bad: often more work than in fully integrated solutions, no settled patterns, no magic

- Tweet: a proposed talk for djangocon eu:
"From React to htmx on a real-world SaaS product: we did it, and it's awesome!"
https://pretalx.evolutio.pt/djangocon-europe-2022/talk/review/99HRMWXMMTYN3T9RMYZFFWHTZ9TBFPKP…
demos are great, but real world examples of moving SPA to htmx/HDA are the gold standard for establishing the credibility of the approach!
