ThePrimeagen is a huge tech influencer on multiple platforms including Twitter, Twitch, and Youtube.

After some OCaml developers started streaming HTMX on Twitch, ThePrimeagen asked developers on twitter if that really was a thing. @htmx_org responded and joked that HTMX was made specifically for ocaml.

**Quote @htmx_org**
> hell yea it is, i made htmx *specifically* for ocaml
(and also for every other server-side language that isn't javascript)

After some hesitation, ThePrimeagen followed HTMX for the memes it was making. He decided to explore it on stream.

**Quote @ThePrimeagen:**

ThePrimeagen hosted many more streams with HTMX, started telling people how to use it, and shared a bunch of HTMX memes on Twitter.
