## The `class reference` Expression

### Syntax

`.<class name>`

### Description

The class reference expression uses a syntax from CSS selectors to reference all elements with a given class. It typically
evaluates to a NodeList of all matching classes, unless it is used as the
right hand side of an assignment.

### Examples

```html
<div _="on click add .clicked">Add the .clicked class to me!</div>

<div _="on click log .clicked">
  Log all elements with the clicked class on it in the DOM
</div>
```
