## Backstory

The HTMX Horse started as a joke response to a tweet by @ThePrimeagen:

> its funny how much htmx gets attacked for its simplicity
> the speed at which developers trade simplicity for complexity at the feet of the DX idol is nutty

**Quote Response @htmx_org**
> a very good point made by an obviously good looking, successful & talented person
> rather than doing everything for you, htmx tries to provide relatively simple building blocks that compose well w/ each other & other tools/libraries

Shortly after, @htmx_org tweeted a picture of a [Morbid Enterprises Horse Mask](https://www.amazon.com/-/he/M37231/dp/B00CTA3ZRE) overlaid with the text "HTMX":

> imagine taking what this man has to say seriously

HTMX changed its twitter profile picture to the horse.

### Laser Eyes

Shortly after the "Lasers of Peace" trend started off, HTMX added laser eyes to the horse image and set it as its new profile picture.

Some AI Images of Laser Horses were generated

> very dangerous!

### Half-Drawn Horse

@WarrenInTheBuff (WarrenBuffering) created a "Wanted" poster for a $1000 reward with the "half-drawn horse" meme/sketch (same thing). HTMX switched its profile picture to the half-drawn horse.

**Quote @WarrenInTheBuff:**
> ðŸš¨ PSA: BOLO ðŸš¨
> Suspect does not have arms but is an incredibly dangerous and notorious s-word poster
> DO NOT APPROACH! Report sightings to our anonymous #OperationReturnToBird tips hotline

Due to the ongoing Lasers of Peace trend, HTMX quickly added laser eyes to their new profile picture.

### End of the Trend

Some people, including @htmx_org started using AI to generate HTMX memes:

**Quote @htmx_org**
> some people are afraid of the AI future
> **Quoting @IroncladDev:**
> > Final Result:

After someone created an AI-generated image of a Bison with Laser Eyes, HTMX adopted that as its profile picture.

**Quote @htmx_org**

> > ![An AI-generated image of an armored bison with laser eyes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F7IGxltasAAiQyb?format=jpg&name=small)

After that, some people started making memes with the new Bison, putting an end to the Horse trend and starting the Bison Trend.
