A few other jokes were made about hypermedia/XSS concerns. HTMX responded to many of these saying that it was a library of peace.

Some time After HTMX adopted the horse as its profile image, the horse was updated laser beams protruding from its eyes.

Out of sarcasm, someone made a joke about laser eyes being peaceful. @htmx_org would respond in a similar way, unintentionally starting a hype trend that would radiate across Tech Twitter:

**Quote @htmx_org**
> they are lasers of peace
> **Quoting @justinrassier:**
> > Ah yes. Nothing screams “peace” like lasers being shot out of one’s eyes

Many developers posted modified images of programming languages, libraries, frameworks, and tools with laser eyes.

The Bun 1.0 release slowed down the HTMX trend a bit.

In habit, @htmx_org posted a picture of the Bun logo with Laser Eyes.
