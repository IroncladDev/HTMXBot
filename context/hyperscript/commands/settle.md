## The `settle` Command

### Syntax

```ebnf
  settle [<expression>]
```

### Description

The `settle` command allows you to synchronize on the CSS transition of an element. It will listen for the
`transitionend` even on the given element (or `me` if no element is given).

If a `transitionstart` event is not received within 500ms, the command will continue assuming that no
transition will occur.

### Examples

```html
<style>
  #pulsar {
    transition: all 800ms ease-in-out;
  }
  .red {
    background: red;
  }
</style>
<div
  id="pulsar"
  _="on load repeat 6 times
                toggle .red then settle"
>
  You thought the blink tag was dead?
</div>
```
