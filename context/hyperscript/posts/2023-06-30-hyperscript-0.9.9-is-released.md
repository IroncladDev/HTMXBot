## hyperscript 0.9.9 Release

We are pleased to present the [0.9.9 release](https://unpkg.com/browse/hyperscript.org@0.9.9/) of hyperscript.

### Changes

* A new [cookie API](/expressions/cookies) was added
* The `beep!` print-debug tool can now be used [as a command](/commands/beep)
* The [comparison expression](/expressions/comparison-operator) now supports additional syntax:
  * `is equal to`
  * `equals`
  * `is really equal to`
  * etc.
* A few other smaller bug fixes

Enjoy!
