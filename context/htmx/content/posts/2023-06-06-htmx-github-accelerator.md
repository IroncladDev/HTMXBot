We are excited to announce that htmx has been accepted into the first class of the 
[GitHub Open Source Accelerator](https://accelerator.github.com/)!  This is a tremendous opportunity to work with and
learn from some of the most successful open source developers and projects, and a great chance to get the message
out about hypermedia and htmx.

We plan on using this opportunity to begin work on htmx 2.0 and, we hope, possibly learn how to make working on htmx
a full time job!
