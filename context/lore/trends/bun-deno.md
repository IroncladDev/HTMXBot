# Bun/Deno trend
Shortly after the "rüne foundation" trend following the release of Svelte Runes, Bun 1.0 was released. Being a master at catching on to new tech trends, @htmx_org tweeted that bun was compatible with HTMX.

**Quote @htmx_org**
> you can use htmx w/bun, btw

@htmx_org updated its profile picture to the bun logo, removing the face and adding the text "HTMX" on it. The official twitter account for bun wasn't particularly happy.

**Quote @bunjavascript**

@htmx_org quoted this tweet and switched its trajectory to the Deno logo.

Someone pointed out that there weren't any lasers on the logo. Taking swift action, HTMX modified the "HTMX Deno" logo to have laser eyes.

The Bun 1.0 hype took tech twitter by storm and slowed down the HTMX trend a bit.

**Quote @htmx_org**

Someone had a genius idea of putting the Deno in a Bun. @htmx quickly added a new modification to the already-corrupted Deno/HTMX log

**Quote @htmx_org**
> htmx twitter found a way

Remembering that NodeJS was another Javascript Runtime Framework, someone said to put a Node on the Bun. HTMX named its new hybrid logo monstrosity creation the "debunode"

**Quote @htmx_org**
> you can use htmx w/ debunode, btw

Someone created another bun/deno logo hybrid and commented about @htmx_org's unprofessional design skills.

**Quote @natetronn:**
> It's obvious to me that @htmx_org has no creative design skills. I mean, did you see their logo?
> ![The Deno logo modified to have the Bun logo as its head, hands on hips being the "<>" in the XML logo](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F57SjazaQAAMpHi?format=png&name=small)

Slightly beforehand, the official Bun twitter account responed to HTMX's tweet about compatibility with HTMX and bun saying React was better. Replying to the tweet, Bun created a short twitter thread.

**Quote @bunjavascript:**
> it's true

> react is better tho

HTMX created two variations of the bun logo in response to being owned by the thread by @bunjavascript.

**Quote @htmx_org:**
> bun really said

With the ongoing hype of Svelte runes, the "rüne foundation" trend, and the endorsement of HTMX by die-hard rust developers, HTMX considered "the_rüst_roundation.js" as its new title.

**Quote @htmx_org:**
> strongly considering
> ![The "Bilbo baggins why not" meme captioned with "After all... why not? Why shouldn't I rename htmx to the_rüst_foundation.js?"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F6U_16JXMAABCga?format=jpg&name=small)

HTMX renamed the "debunode" to the "bunodeno" and modified it again.

**Quote @htmx_org:**
> you've heard of punished bunodeno
> but are you ready for rüsted (foundation) bunodeno?
> ![The deno logo with laser eyes and a NodeJS hat, sandwiched in a hotdog bun. The Rust gear logo modified to have an "H" instead of an "R" with "tmx" concatenated to it to form "HTMX"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F6VCD-3WIAAFoU8?format=jpg&name=small)

@htmx_org put forth another joke following this.

**Quote @htmx_org**
> htmx works great on bunodeno brought to you by the rüst foundation, btw

Somehow, the golang gopher was fit into the picture.

**Quote @htmx_org**
> I bet you won't fit a gopher in there

Someone commentented that HTMX forgot to add a camel.

**Quote @salacio:**
> Still no camel.
**Replying to @salacio: @htmx_org:**
> i'm just one man

Someone managed to fit all the logos (excluding the laser eyes of peace) into one picture.

**Quoting @IroncladDev:**
> I'm here for ya bro

Shortly after this, the Bun 1.0 hype ended and Svelte Runes cooled off, leading to the end of the trend.
