## The `event handler` Feature

Event handlers are used to handle events with hyperscript. They are typically embedded directly on the element that
is responding to the event.

### Syntax

```ebnf
on [every] <event-name>[(<param-list>)][\[<filter>\]] [<count>] [from <expr>] [<debounce> | <throttle>]
   { or [every] <event-name>[(<param-list>)][\[<filter>\]] [<count>] [from <expr>] [<debounce> | <throttle>] }
    [queue (all | first | last | none)]
    {<command>}
[end]
```

If the `every` prefix is used, the event handler will not be synchronized (see [queueing](#queueing) below.)

The `event-name` can be a symbol, a dot-separated symbol or a string that names the event. The most obvious events
of interest are are [standard HTML DOM events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp) such as click,
focus/blur, change, etc. There are [many, many standard browser events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events) that
may be of interest depending on what you are trying to build. You may also wish to define your own events for higher level abstractions.

The optional `param-list` is a comma separated list of parameter names. Parameters will be set from properties directly
on the event or in the `details` property.

The optional `filter` is a boolean expression that will filter the event. Symbols in the expression will be resolved
against the event first, then against the global scope.

The optional `count` is a count filter with a value of either a specific number, a range or an unbounded start:

```
  on click 1
  on click 2 to 10
  on click 11 and on
```

You can then optionally listen to an event from another element using the `from <expr>` syntax, including the special
value `elsewhere`, which will listen for the event from elsewhere in the DOM.  (This is useful if you want "click-away to
close" behavior.)

Finally an event can specify a `debounced at` or `throttled at` value to debounce or throttle the events.

```text
  -- will wait until 500ms have passed without a keyup to trigger
  on keyup debounced at 500ms ...
  -- will fire every 500ms regardless of the number of events
  on mousemove throttled at 500ms ...
```

Events can be repeated separated by an `or` to assign one handler to multiple events:

```html
<div _="on click or touchbegin fetch /example then put it into my innerHTML">
  Fetch it...
</div>
```

The `queue` keyword allows you to specify an event queue strategy across all events for the handler (see [queueing](#queueing) below.)

The body is a list of [commands](/docs#commands), optionally separated by the `then` keyword

The `end` is optional if you are chaining `on` features together

### Description

The `on` feature is the primary way to hook hyperscript into the DOM event system. It is typically placed on
DOM elements directly, using the `_`, `script` or `data-script` attribute.

The `on` handler can specify parameters. The value of these parameters destructured from properties on the `event` or`event.detail`
object of the triggering event and matched by name.

So if an event has the value `event.detail.foo = "bar"` then the `on` declaration could look like this:

```html
<div _="on anEvent(foo) log foo">Log Foo</div>
```

The `event` symbol is always available in an `on` feature and is set to the triggering event. So the above could
be written in the following more long-winded manner:

```html
<div _="on anEvent log event.detail.foo">Log Foo</div>
```

When the element is removed, the listener is removed too -- even if it's
listening to another element that's still in the document:

```html
Count: <output _="
on click from #inc
	log "Increment"
	increment my textContent
init
	remove me
">0</output>

<!--After the <output/> is removed, clicking this will not log anything to
	the console-->
<button id="inc">Increment</button>
```

### Event Queuing

You can control the event queuing behavior of an event handler by using the `every` and `queue` keyword.

If you prefix the event with `every` then every time the event is triggered the event handler will fire, even
if a previous event has not completed. The event handlers will run in parallel, and there will be no
queuing of events.

If you postfix the event with `queue` you may pick from one of four strategies:

- `none` - Any events that arrive while the event handler is active will be dropped
- `all` - All events that arrive will be added to a queue and handled in order
- `first` - The first event that arrives will be queued, all others will be dropped
- `last` - The last event that arrives will be queued, all others will be dropped

`queue last` is the default behavior

### Exceptions

If an exception occurs during an event handler, the `exception` event will be triggered on the element, and may
be handled as a normal event:

```html
<div
  _="on click call mightThrow()
        on exception(error) log error"
>
  Click Me!
</div>
```

#### Mutation Events

Hyperscript includes a few synthetic events that make use of more complex APIs. For example, you can listen for
mutations on an element with the `on mutation` form. This will use the [Mutation Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MutationObserver)
API, but will act more like a regular event handler.

```html
<div _='on mutation of @foo put "Mutated" into me'></div>
```

This div will listen for mutations of the `foo` attribute on this div and, when one occurs, will put the value
"Mutated" into the element.

#### Intersection Events

Another synthetic event is the `intersection` event that uses the [Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)
API. Again, hyperscript makes this API feel more event-driven:

```html
<img
  _="on intersection(intersecting) having threshold 0.5
         if intersecting transition opacity to 1
         else transition opacity to 0 "
  src="https://placebear.com/200/300"
/>
```

This image will become visible when 50% or more of it has scrolled into view. Note that the `intersecting` property
is destructured into a local symbol, and the `having threshold` modifier is used to specify that 50% of the image
must be showing.

Here is a demo:

<img _="on intersection(intersecting) having threshold 0.5
         if intersecting transition opacity to 1
         else transition opacity to 0 "
     src="https://placebear.com/200/300"/>

### Examples

```html
<div _="on click call alert('You clicked me!')">Click Me!</div>

<div
  _="on mouseenter add .visible to #help end
        on mouseleave remove .visible from #help end"
>
  Mouse Over Me!
</div>
<div id="help">I'm a helpful message!</div>
```
