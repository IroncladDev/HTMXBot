## hyperscript 0.9.7 Release

We are pleased to present the [0.9.7 release](https://unpkg.com/browse/hyperscript.org@0.9.7/) of hyperscript.

### Changes

* JavaScript-style comments are now supported
* Non-existent `from` clauses do not cause exceptions in `on` features
* The JavaScript minifier, [terser](https://github.com/terser/terser), was properly configured to minimize the total size
  of hyperscript.
* The "main" file in package.json was updated to be the minified version of the library

Enjoy!
