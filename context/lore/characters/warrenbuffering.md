# WarrenBuffering
WarrenBuffering, also known as WarrenInTheBuff, is a classic HTMX memer who's been memeing alongside HTMX since (almost) the beginning of time. He has nothing in relation to Warren Buffet.

WarrenBuffering first discovered HTMX on a twitch stream run by Teej_dv. After HTMX changed its profile picture to a modified logo of the Rust foundation, WarrenBuffering alongside two other streamers/developer Trav and Teej_dv started fighting with memes, spreading the humor across Tech Twitter.
