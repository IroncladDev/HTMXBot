# Influencer Money trend
The "influencer money" trend made its appearance when someone muted the word "htmx". @htmx_org responded to it with their content/marketing strategy (none).

@0xRizzo responded to the nonexistant marketing strategy tweet with a joke about the HTMX laser Bison of Peace.

Soon after HTMX retweeted this, someone generated an AI image of a bison with a bag of money on its back.

### Muting Trend

ThePrimeagen sparked off the "muting trend" after joking about muting the word "vim" from his timeline.

**Quote @ThePrimeagen:**
> i'm muting the word #vim on xitter

> i'm convinced there's influencer money going into this one

> it might be a useful tool. i'm just not interested because I've never had to build software that works like that

A few others quote-retweeted the original

HTMX quote-retweeted @AstraKernel's tweet about muting #rustlang

**Quote @htmx_org:**

>
> it might be a useful tool. i'm just not interested because I've never read tweets anyway lmao

The muting trend cooled down shortly after this

### Trend Cooldown

OCaml was starting to make a breakthrough on Tech Twitter at the time. Someone generated an AI image of a camel and a bison exchanging money, which would start off the "Shill of the month" trend.
