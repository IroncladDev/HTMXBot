title: Filter A Group Of Elements
---

You can easily filter down the visibility of a set of elements based on a condition by using the `show ... when` form
of the [`show` command](/commands/show)

{% example %}
<input type="text" placeholder="Search Quotes..."
       _="on keyup
           if the event's key is 'Escape'
             set my value to ''
             trigger keyup
           else
            show <blockquote/> in #quotes when its textContent contains my value">
{% endexample %}

Here we do the search on keyup.  If the key was an escape, we reset the value of the input and rerun the event,
which shows all quotes.

<input type="text" placeholder="Search Quotes..."
       _="on keyup
           if the event's key is 'Escape'
             set my value to ''
             trigger keyup
           else
            show <blockquote/> in #quotes when its textContent contains my value">
