## Introduction

Expressions in hyperscript are a mix of familiar and new.  Many of the expected operations from javascript are there:

* Common literals: `1 true "this is a string" null`
* List and object literals: `[1, 2, 3], {foo:"bar", [computeKey()]: computeValue()}`

Most of the common comparison and mathematical operators are there as well:

```text
  x > 10
  y == null
  lst.length < 5
  a + b < 42
```

There are some minor improvements to them:

*	Property names in object literals can contain hyphens. This is convenient for representing CSS:

	`add { font-weight: bold } to the #element in me`

However, once you get past the basics, hyperscript starts to get a little wild.

Let's start with CSS literals.

## CSS Literals

Hyperscript gives you the ability to embed CSS literals directly in your code to select elements.  There are four
main expression types:

### ID Literals

You can refer to an element by ID directly in hyperscript as follows:

```html
<div _="on click put 'Clicked!' into #example.innerHTML">Click Me</div>
<div id="example"></div>
```

The `#example` is an ID literal and will evaluate to the element with the given id.  Here we put some text into its
`innerHTML` when the top div is clicked.

### Class Literals

You can refer to a group of elements by class directly in hyperscript as follows:

```html
<div _="on click put 'Clicked!' into .example.innerHTML">Click Me</div>
<div class="example"></div>
<div class="example"></div>
```

The `#example` is an ID literal and will evaluate all the elements with the class `example` on them.  Here we put some
text into their `innerHTML` when the top div is clicked.  Note that the [put command](/commands/put) can work with
collections as well as single values, so it can put the given value into all the returned elements.

### Query Literals

You can refer to a group of elements by an arbitrary [CSS selector](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)
 by enclosing the selector in a `<` and `/>`:

```html
<div _="on click put 'Clicked!' into <div/>.innerHTML">Click Me</div>
<div class="example"></div>
<div class="example"></div>
```

This example will put "Clicked" into every div on the page!

```html
<div _="on click put 'Clicked!' into <div:not(.example)/>.innerHTML">Click Me</div>
<div class="example"></div>
<div class="example"></div>
```

This example will put "Clicked" into every div that does not have the `example` class on it.

We can also refer to `<html/>`, `<body/>`, or even `<:root>`:

```html
<button _="on click toggle @data-theme='light' on <:root/>">Dark/Light</button>
```

This example will toggle the `data-theme='light'` property on `:root` so we can toggle css-variable values as follows:

```css
:root {
  --bg-color: black;
  --text-color: white;
}

:root[data-theme='light'] {
  --bg-color: white;
  --text-color: black;
}
```

### Attribute Literals

Finally, you can refer to an attribute with two syntaxes:

```html
<div foo="bar" _="on click put @foo into me">Click Me</div>
<div _="on click toggle [@foo='bar'] into me">Click Me</div>
```

The short syntax, `@<attribute name>` can be used to get or set attribute values, and may be chained with
possessives:

```hyperscript
for anchor in <a/>
  log the anchor's @href
end
```

or with non-possessive property chains:

```hyperscript
for anchor in <a/>
  log anchor@href
end
```

The longer syntax, surrounding the `@<attribute-name>` with square brackets, may be used for queries that require a
value, or for commands like `toggle` or `add` that require a value

```hyperscript
for anchor in [@href]
  log anchor@href
end
```

### In Expressions

The `in` expression isn't a literal, but can be used in conjunction with them for common patterns:

```html
<div _="on click put 'Clicked!' into (<p/> in me).innerHTML">Click Me
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
</div>
```

The `in` expression in this case evaluates the query in the given context on the right hand side.  Here we are looking
up paragraph tags inside the clicked element (`me`) and setting their `innerHTML` to "Clicked!"

## Comparisons

In addition to the typical comparison operators, such as `==` and `!=`, hyperscript supports the following natural
language aliases

* `is` - equivalent to `==`: `1 is 1`
* `is not` - equivalent to `!=`: `1 is not 1`
* `am` - equivalent to `==`: `I am 1`
* `am not` - equivalent to `!=`: `I am not 1`
* `no` - equivalent to `!= null`: `no .example in me`

Note that `I` is an alias for `me`, the current element.

Furthermore, hyperscript supports two more comparison operators: `matches` and `contains` which can be used in the
following forms:

```text
  I match <:hover/>
  it matches <:hover/>
  I do not match <:hover/>
  it does not match <:hover/>
```

```text
  I contain <:focus/>
  it contains <:focus/>
  I do not contain <:focus/>
  it does not contain <:focus/>
```

## Strings

Strings are similar to javascript, and can start with `"` or `'`.

```html
<div _="on click set world to 'hyperscript' put 'Hello $world' into my innerHTML">
  Click Me
</div>
```

In a few places, hyperscript allows "naked" strings, strings without a leading quote or double quote.  An example is
the [fetch command](/commands/fetch), which can take a URL as a naked string:

```html
<button _="on click fetch /example then put it into my innerHTML">
    Fetch It!
</button>
```

Here the `/example` element is an example of a naked string.  Naked strings are ended by whitespace.

Javascript string templates are supported by using the same syntax, enclosing backtics:

```html
<button _="on click fetch /example then put `result: ${the result}` into my innerHTML">
    Fetch It!
</button>
```

## Possessive Expressions

The possessive expression is an expression that starts with `my` or `its` or a symbol followed by a `'s' and that is
roughly the equivalent of a property acesss

```html
<div _="on click put the window's location into me">
  Click Me
</div>
```

This is equivalent to:

```html
<div _="on click put window.location into me">
  Click Me
</div>
```

You may also access and set DOM attributes using the possessive with attribute literals:

<div _="on click from body in <a/>
          put its @href into me
          halt -- prevent the default">
  Click on Links To See The URL
</div>


## Conversions

Hyperscript centralizes conversions into a single construct, the `as` expression:

```text
  10 as String
  "10" as Int
  "10.3" as Float
```

Out of the box hyperscript provides the following conversions:

* `String` - converts to string
* `Int` - converts to an integer
* `Float` - converts to a float
* `Number` - converts to a number
* `Date` - converts to a date

## Null Safety

The `.` operator in hyperscript is null safe, so `elt.parent` will evaluate to `null` if `elt` is null

## Array Expansion

Properties on arrays, except for `length`, are expanded via a [flat map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/flatMap)

```text
  set divs to </div>                      -- get all divs in the document
  set divParents to divs.parentElement    -- get all parents of those divs
  set divChildren to divs.children        -- get all children of those divs
```

## Blocks

Hyperscript does not have anonymous functions or complex arrow functions.  Because hyperscript is [async transparent](/docs#async)
complicated callbacks are generally not necessary.

However it does support a simple, expression-only version of arrow functions called "blocks", with a slightly different
syntax:

```text
    set strs to ["a", "ab", "abc"]
    set lens to strs.map( \ s -> s.length )
```

Blocks start with a backslash, followed by args, then an `->` and then an expression value.

## Async

By default, hyperscript synchronizes on any [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
that go through its runtime.  Consider the following code:

```html
<script type="text/hyperscript">
def waitThenReturn10()
    wait 10ms
    return 10
end
</script>
<button _="on click put 'The answer was $waitThenReturn10()' into my.innerHTML">
  Click Me...
</button>
```

Here we have an asynchronous function with a `wait` in it that will cause the function to return a Promise rather than
the value.  Hyperscript will "pause" evaluation of the event handler until that promise resolves and can provide a
value to the string expression, and then continue.  This is very cool and is usually what you want.

However, there may be a case where you don't want hyperscript to pause and, instead, want to pass the raw promise on
somewhere else.  To do this, you can use the `async` prefix for the expression

```html
<button _="on click call handleAPromise(async waitThenReturn10())">
  Click Me...
</button>
```

Here we pass the promise returned by `waitThenReturn10()` out to `handleAPromise()`, *as* a Promise, rather than resolving
it.

## Time Expressions

In a few places in the hyperscript grammar you can use "time expressions", which are just natural ways to specify
a time interval.  The [wait command](/commands/wait) is one such place:

```html
<button _="on click wait 2s then put 'I waited!' into my.innerHTML">
  Click to Wait...
</button>
```

You can use the following formats for time expressions:

* `10 ms` - milliseconds
* `10 milliseconds` - milliseconds
* `10 s` - seconds
* `10 seconds` - seconds

Note that a space between the number and modifier are not necessary, and that the `ms` modifier is just for clarity
since milliseconds is the normal interpretation for things like `setTimeout()`, which the wait command is based on.

## Of Expressions

The [`of`](/expressions/of) expression allows you to reverse the normal object oriented syntax and write logic in more natural english

```html
  <button _="on click call window.location.reload()">
    Reload the Location
  </button>
```

Can be rewritten like this:

```html
  <button _="on click reload() the location of the window">
    Reload the Location
  </button>
```

## Closest Expressions

The [`closest`](/expressions/closest) expression allows you to find the closest match of a CSS selector

```html
<%!-- logs the closest section to the div -->
<div _="on click log the closest <section/>">
  ...
</div>
```

If you pass an attribute literal to the closest expression, it will evaluate to the value of that attribute on the
closest element that has it:

```html
<%!-- logs the data-example attribute's value from the body tag -->
<body data-example="An example attribute">
    <div _="on click log the closest @data-example">
      ...
    </div>
</body>
```

You can use the `parent` modifier in the closest expression to begin the search from the parent element of the current
element:

```html
<%!-- logs the closest parent div to this div -->
<div _="on click log the closest parent <div/>">
  ...
</div>
```

## Positional Expressions

The [positional expressions](/expressions/positional/), `first`, `last` and `random`  allows you to get the
first, last or a random element from an array-like object

```html
<%!-- logs the first section in the document -->
<div _="on click log the first <section/>">
  ...
</div>
```

## Relative Positional Expressions

The [relative positional expressions](/expressions/relative-positional/), `next` and `previous`  allows you refer to the
next or previous element of a given type within a linear, depth first forward or backward scan of the elements in the
DOM tree

```html
<%!-- add the focused class to the next div in the dom with the header class on it -->
<div _="on click add .focused to the next <div.header/>">
  ...
</div>
```

## The Cookies Symbol

The `cookies` symbol is an automatically available symbol in all contexts that presents a 
[localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)-like API for accessing cookies:

```hyperscript
  set cookies.myCookie to 'foo'     # sets the cooke 'myCookie' to the value true, forever
  set cookies['myCookie'] to 'bar'  # updates the previous cookies value
  set cookies['myCookie'] to 
    {value: 'doh', 
     expires: maxAge:6000}          # set value and make it expire in 6000 seconds or 100 minutes 
  cookies.clear('myCookie')         # clears the given cookie
  cookies.clearAll()                # clears all cookies
  cookies.length                    # returns the number of cookies
  cookies[0]                        # returns the first cookie as a {name:<name>, value:<value>} struct
  for c in cookies ... end          # iterates over all cookies as {name:<name>, value:<value>} structs
```
