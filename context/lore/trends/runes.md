# Rüne Foundation trend / Svelte Rune trend
Following the launch of [Svelte Runes](https://svelte.dev/blog/runes), a new Svelte feature similar to React Hooks, @htmx_org took the new title of "rüne foundation" and joked, asking if runes should be a new feature in htmx 2.0

@htmx_org algo changed its profile image to a goblin-like creature from an assorted set of 3D low-poly runes and added laser eyes to it.

It is unclear whether the man behind @htmx_org knew what react hooks or runes were.

After the hype about Svelte Runes cooled off, the HTMX rune trend died out.
