# Professional trend / Corporate trend / Tie trend
After reading a book titled "Going Corporate: A Geek's Guide", @htmx_org added a tie to its profile picture in pursuit of changing the account from a shitposting one to a corporate/professional.

**Quote @htmx_org**
> OK, so I just finished this book "Going Corporate: A Geek's Guide" &amp; it was *very* interesting, looking into this "money" thing: did u know you can buy stuff with it?

Shortly after switching to a corporate and professional profile image, @htmx_org tried to grab the attention of professionals to no avail.

**Quote @htmx_org:**
> dear business owners &amp; business owner employees:
> htmx is a business oriented javascript framework that
> - lowers costs ðŸ’µ
> - increases ROI ðŸ’¸
> - is interest rate resilient ðŸ“ˆ
> we here at htmx inc look forward to assisting in your incredible journey to hypermedia hyperprofitability

After a first failed attempt to reach professional investors, HTMX quote-retweeted the original "professional" tweet:

**Quote @htmx_org:**
> we here at htmx inc should clarify (to the business owners, obv) that when we say "lowers costs" we mean the business owner employees (you, the reader)
> increases ROI, same
> we look forward to working with you (the business owners)

Some people started making memes about the professional behavior of HTMX.

**Quote @htmx_org:**
> corporate espionage has already begun, bodes well
> > **Quoting @IroncladDev:**
> > Shortly after the discovery of money
> > HTMX team offsite / onsite (same thing)
> > Everyone got a tie as well

### Trend cooldown

It appeared to be a true challenge for the man behind @htmx_org to speak in a professional manner.

As soon as the "Lasers of Peace" trend broke through Tech Twitter, HTMX broke loose from its corporate/professional bonds (same thing) and resumed the shitposting journey.
