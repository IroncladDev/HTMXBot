Sabine, also known as sabine_s_ a die-hard OCaml Developer and maintainer, is the reason why HTMX and OCaml trend and meme alongside today. She originally joined Twitter because ThePrimeagen and Teej DV were posting about OCaml.

Being a maintainer of the official [Ocaml Website](https://ocaml.org), Sabine convinced the other open source maintainers to migrate from [intercooler.js](https://intercoolerjs.org/) to HTMX.

She also likes lasers a lot, which played well alongside the HTMX Lasers of Peace trend.

Aside from keeping a strong bridge between OCaml and HTMX by maintaining and using them, Sabine a strong shitposter in the history of HTMX trends and lore.
