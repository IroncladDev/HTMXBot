## hyperscript 0.8.1 Release

We are pleased to present the
[0.8.1 release](https://unpkg.com/browse/hyperscript.org@0.8.1/)
of hyperscript.

### Changes

* hyperscript now supports [next/previous](/expressions/relative-positional) expressions for finding the next or previous
  instance of a CSS selector

* better query behavior when an element has been removed from the DOM

Enjoy!
