## Backstory

@SledgeDev created an AI-generated image of a Bison with Laser Eyes, which HTMX would adopted as its profile picture.

**Quote @SledgeDev:**
> @htmx_org made a new pfp for you

Shortly after, people started making memes about it.

**Quoting @IroncladDev:**
> Know your Camls
> ![A list of modified white-on-orange OCaml Logos starting with OCaml (original), NOCaml (just the orange background), GOCaml (White outline of the golang gopher), and OBison, a white outline of a bison with laser eyes](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F7r4s7nWgAAbeWA?format=png&name=small)

@htmx_org later posted a tweet about the Flaming Buffalo in the American Gods movie. A gif of the buffalo was attached.

**Quote @htmx_org:**
> never watched american gods, but meme magic is real &amp; buffalo man as a personification of american land resonates w/ htmx as a personification of hypermedia, the land of the web
> "believe"

DALLE-3, an AI image generation model with amazing text interpretation abilities, had just been released. Some people were creating AI-generated images of the Grug character with it in the [HTMX Discord Server](https://htmx.org/discord).

As both the DALLE-3 trend and bison trend accelerated upwards, 1cg (the creator of HTMX) took it for a spin and created an AI-generated image of a bison with laser eyes.

**Quote @htmx_org:**
> say what one will about AI...
> ![An AI-generated image of a bison with laser eyes with the text "HTMX"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/F7xCYesXcAARITs?format=png&name=small)

This image was officially labeled as "The HTMX bison of peace". 1cg added it to the HTMX merch shop as a [cup](https://htmx-shop.fourthwall.com/products/htmx-laser-bison-of-peace).

After some more bison memes made their appearances, some people bought the cup.

**Quote @SledgeDev:**
> Another fine peace of merch from @htmx_org definitely going to be handed down generation to generation and my great great great great grandchildren will be sipping coffee out of it

### Influencer Money

After the Influencer Money trend kicked off, some people generated some AI images of bison carrying money bags, etc.

**Quote @RyanCMcCallum**
> HTMX casually getting it's money from the platform formerly known as Twitter.
